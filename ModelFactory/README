----------------------------------------------

The ModelFactory toolkit is a set of scripts in Matlab(R)/Octave that can be used to create rigid-body models of humans and objects. By default a graphical user interface is included that works on Matlab (tested on Matlab 2017a(R)), and a text based interface for Matlab(R)/ Octave (tested on Octave 4.2.1, https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/). 

Developments of the toolkit can be followed on: https://github.com/manishsreenivasa/ModelFactory
